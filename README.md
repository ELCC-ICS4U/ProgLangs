## Programming Languages

A __quick__ investigation of some *different* common programming languages.

- [Java](java.md)
- [C](c.md)
- [NodeJS](NodeJS.md)
- [Rust](Rust.md)
- [SwiftR](SwiftR.md)

Each student should create a new branch (named with your initials).

In your branch, crate a MarkDown file (e.g. _Java.md_, _Python.md_). In this file add the following:

- A logo image _(add the log to the images folder, named after your language)_
- A short description of the language
- State its primary uses
- Outline any possible limitations
- Create a table stating:

| Language Feature       | Yes _or_ No |
|------------------------|-------------|
| Is it Imperative?      | _Y / N_     |
| Is it Functional?      | _Y / N_     |
| Is it Object-Oriented? | _Y / N_     |
| Is it Interpreted?     | _Y / N_     |
| Is it Concurrent?      | _Y / N_     |
| Is it Standardized?    | _Y / N_     |
